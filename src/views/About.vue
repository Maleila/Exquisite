      The exquisite corpse is a poem, story, or drawing generated by a group
      where each group member can only see a small piece of the whole. This
      technique was first used by surrealists around 1918 in the form of poetry.
      The original game relied on a template (i.e, "The adjective noun adverb
      verb the adjective noun"), but the game can also be played by folding down
      the paper after each turn so that a given contributer sees only the
      previous sentence. Though the game began as a diversion, the surrealists
      also saw it as a way to unlock creativity and construct as a group that
      which was impossible to form individually. Years later, surrealist Andre
      Breton reflected that
      <b
        >"Finally, with the Exquisite Corpse we had at our command an infallible
        way of holding the critical intellect in abeyance, and of fully
        liberating the mind's metaphorical activity."</b
      >
      Whether as a serious storytelling endeavour or a fun and chaotic way to
      relax with friends, we hope you will find this same joy of creativity and
      collaboration in Exquisite!
